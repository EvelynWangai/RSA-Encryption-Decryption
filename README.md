# RSA-Encryption-Decryption Mini project

In this project we are building an RSA encryption-decryption machine. For this you will need to know how
to:
       ● Create an RSA key pair
       ● Encrypt using a public key
       ● Decrypt using a private key

The encryption script should take a string as user input (you can use Python’s input() function
for that), and print the cipher.

The decryption script should be capable of taking the cipher as user input and printing the
original message. Since the cipher is a list of integers, the description script must have some
way of reading the cipher one element at a time (e.g. by separating the numbers with commas
(33,66,77,88))

I have uploaded both the encryption and decryption scripts.
